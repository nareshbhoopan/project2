    <p>Dance is an art form, often classified as a sport, consisting of sequences of body movements with 
        aesthetic and often symbolic value, either improvised or purposefully selected.[nb 1] Dance can be
         categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements or by its historical
          period or place of origin.[3] Dance is typically performed with musical accompaniment, and sometimes
           with the dancer simultaneously using a musical instrument themselves.

        An important distinction is to be drawn between theatrical and participatory dance,[4] although
         these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether
          social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, sacred or liturgical. Other forms of human movement 
        are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts, gymnastics,</p>
