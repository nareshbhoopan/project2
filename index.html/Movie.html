    <p>Chennai 600028 is a 2007 Indian Tamil-language sports comedy film written and directed by Venkat Prabhu 
        in his directorial debut. It stars Jai, Shiva, Premji, Aravind Akash, Nithin Sathya and newcomers Ajay Raj,
         Vijay Vasanth, Prasanna, Inigo Prabakaran, Karthik and Arun in the lead along with Vijayalakshmi Feroz and 
         Kristine Zedek, making their acting debuts as well. The film was produced by S. P. B. Charan along with J.
          K. Saravana, a Singapore-based award-winning producer.[2] The film's score and soundtrack were composed by 
          Premji Amaran and Yuvan Shankar Raja respectively.

        The film is based on street cricket played in India, focusing on various themes such as friendship,
         love and rivalry in a suburban area.[3] Following its theatrical release on 27 April 2007, it received
          critical acclaim and emerged as a surprise sleeper hit, running successfully for more than one year in 
          theatres,[3][4] while going on to achieve cult status in the subsequent years.[5] The film's title is 
          derived from the pincode for Mandaveli, a suburb of Chennai, where the story takes place. The success of
           the film gained the relatively unknown actors â€“ Jai, Shiva, Premji and Nithin Sathya, newcomers Vijayalakshmi 
           and
         Vijay Vasanth and the director Venkat Prabhu popularity.[6]</p>
