    <p>Raavanan is a 2010 Indian Tamil-language epic action-adventure film co-written, co-produced, and directed by Mani Ratnam. The film stars Vikram, Prithviraj Sukumaran and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the lead roles along with a supporting cast led by Karthik, Prabhu and Priyamani. It marked Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's return to Tamil after a decade, since Kandukondain Kandukondain (2000). The film follows the crux of the epic Ramayana, with a ruthless cop named Dev Prakash Subramaniam, who is on a quest to find a tribal leader-turned naxalite named Veeraiya as he had kidnapped his wife Raagini, who is suffering from Stockholm syndrome and begins to develop emotions for Veeraiya after learning his purpose.

        Raavanan was announced in February 2008, amidst much hype of the celebrated director, Mani Ratnam's return to Tamil films, whilst Vikram's and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's casting creating more anticipation. Shooting began soon after, and took place in various locations with a record number of extras in areas including Chalakudy, Kerala and Ooty, Tamil Nadu amongst other regions throughout India. The film's music was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics written by Vairamuthu, the cinematography was handled by V. 
        Manikandan and Santhosh Sivan, and editing done by A. Sreekar Prasad.</p>
