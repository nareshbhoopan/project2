        <p>Pushpa 2: The Rule is an upcoming Indian Telugu-language action drama film directed and written by Sukumar under his banner Sukumar Writings and produced by Naveen Yerneni and Yalamanchili Ravi Shankar under their Mythri Movie Makers banner. The film stars Allu Arjun in the titular role, with the ensemble cast of Fahadh Faasil, Rashmika Mandanna, Dhananjaya, Jagadeesh Prathap Bandari, Rao Ramesh, Ajay, Sunil, Anasuya Bharadwaj, Shanmukh and Ajay Ghosh reprising their roles from the previous film. It is the second installment in the Pushpa film series and the sequel to Pushpa: The Rise.[2]

            10% of the film's footage was initially shot back-to-back with the original film. However, Sukumar decided to alter the story, which led to the film's principal photography commencing in October 2022. Made on a
             budget of â‚¹500 crore,[1][3] the film is one of the most expensive Indian films to date.</p>
