    <>Shivaji Rao Gaikwad[a] (born 12 December 1950), known professionally as Rajinikanth,[b] is
         an Indian actor who predominantly works in Tamil cinema.[5] In a career spanning over five
          decades, he has done 170 films[c] that includes films in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada,
           Bengali, and Malayalam. He is widely regarded to be one of the most successful and popular
            actors in the history of Indian cinema.[6][7] Known for his uniquely styled mannerism and one
             liners in films, he has a huge fan base internationally and has a cult following

        Following his debut in K. Balachander's 1975 Tamil drama Apoorva Raagangal, Rajinikanth's 
        acting career commenced with a brief phase of portraying antagonistic characters in Tamil films. 
        His major positive role as a scorned lover in S. P. Muthuraman's Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri (1977),
         1978's Mullum Malarum and Aval Appadithan received him critical acclaim; the former earned him a 
         Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for Best Actor.[10][11] By the end of the decade, he had
          worked in all South Indian film industries and established a career in Tamil cinema. He then played 
          dual roles in the action thriller Billa (1980), a remake of the Hindi film Don (1978). It was his 
          biggest commercial success to that point, earned him stardom and gave him the action hero image.[12]
           He starred in triple role in Moondru Mugam (1982), which earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu 
           State Film Awards ceremony. The following year, he made his Hindi film debut with T.
         Rama Rao's top grossing Andhaa Kaanoon (1983).[13] Nallavanukku Nallavan (1984)
