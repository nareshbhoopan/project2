        <p>Thangalaan (transl.â€‰Son of gold) is a 2024 Indian Tamil-language action adventure drama film[a] directed by Pa. Ranjith, who co-wrote the script with Tamil Prabha and Azhagiya Periyavan. It is produced by K. E. Gnanavel Raja under Studio Green and Neelam Productions. The film stars Vikram in the titular role, alongside Parvathy Thiruvothu, Malavika Mohanan, Daniel Caltagirone, Pasupathy, Hari Krishnan Anbudurai, Arjun Anbudan and Preeti Karan. Set during the British Raj era, a fierce tribal leader sets out to stop an apparent sorceress, after earning her wrath when assisting a British general in tracing gold in their village.

            The film was officially announced in December 2021 under the tentative title Chiyaan 61, as it is Vikram's 61st film as a lead actor, and the official title was announced in October 2022. Principal photography commenced the same month. It was shot sporadically in several legs, and wrapped by early-July 2023. Filming locations included Chennai, Andhra Pradesh, Madurai and Karnataka. The film has music composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar, cinematography handled by A. Kishor Kumar and editing by Selva RK.
            
            Thangalaan was released worldwide on 15 August 2024 in standard and 3D format, coinciding with India's Independence Day. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the lead cast's performance (especially Vikram, Parvathy Thiruvothu and Daniel Caltagirone), GV Prakash Kumar's background 
            score and Ranjith's screenplay and direction, but the CGI and VFX was criticised.</p>
