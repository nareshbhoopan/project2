        The movie starts with Goutham, as a child, being told that women are all bad and are very selfish by his father Sridhar because his wife had eloped that day. They then move to Chennai, where Goutham meets Sri Harsha and Baby. The trio became inseparable friends. 15 years later, it is shown that they are running an advertising agency, and Goutham has stopped speaking to his father. After a heated incident at a friend's bachelor party, the three friends promise to never get married. They get an advertising offer from Sunny, who sends Priya to assist them with the ad. Sonia, an international model, is assigned to act for the ad. On the day of the shoot, Sonia falls in love with Goutham, and when the ad is finished, she bites his ear. Goutham retaliates by slapping her. Sunny scolds Goutham and tells him that he will never work with him again, but Priya supports Goutham, telling Sunny that it was Sonia's fault for behaving unprofessionally. After the shoot, Goutham calls up Priya and thanks her for supporting him. While speaking to Goutham,
