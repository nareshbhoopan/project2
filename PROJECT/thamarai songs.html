    <p>Thamarai was born in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu on 10 November 1965. She graduated 
        from Government College of Technology, Coimbatore, in production engineering and worked for
         six years in Coimbatore. With her passion for poetry, she decided to move to Chennai, where she worked as
          a freelance journalist in an organization named Bhagya and wrote essays, stories and poems.[2] Through her
          literary works, she became popular and got noticed. Director Seeman assigned her as lyricist for the song
           "Thendral Enthan" for his Tamil film Iniyavale.[3] Subsequently, she wrote lyrics for films such as Unnidathil
        Ennai Koduthen ("Malligai Poove") and Thenali ("Injirango Injirango"). Her work together with music director
         Harris Jayaraj in Minnale marked the turning point in her film industry career, primarily noted for her song
          "Vaseegara" in the movie.[citation needed]

        After Minnale, the trio, composed of director Gautham Vasudev Menon and music director Harris Jayaraj,
         teamed up several times again (Kaakha Kaakha, Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu, Pachaikili Muthucharam and Vaaranam Aayiram)
          and were a very successful collaboration in the film field, until the break-up between Menon and Jayaraj happened. 
          Since then, she is teaming up with A. R. Rahman, who replaced Jayaraj. Menon, Jayaraj and Thamarai teamed up again 
          in July 2014 for the Ajith Kumar film Yennai Arindhaal. The film's album was released on 1 January 2015, and it 
          was well-received by critics.[4][5]
         She wrote" Neeraambal Poovae" from the movie Nannbenda, where she again worked for Harris Jayaraj.</p>
