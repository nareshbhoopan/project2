    <p>Sripathi Panditaradhyula Balasubrahmanyam (4 June 1946 â€“ 25 September 2020), commonly known as SPB, was an
         Indian playback singer, television presenter, actor, music composer, dubbing artist, and film producer.[7]
          He is widely regarded as one of the greatest Indian singers of all time.[11] He predominantly worked in Telugu,
           Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, and Hindi films and sang in a total of 16 languages.[12]

        Balasubrahmanyam was born into a family with a strong musical background in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh.
         Despite initially pursuing engineering, his passion for music led him to a successful career in playback 
         singing, starting with his debut in the Telugu film Sri Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna in 1966, composed by his mentor, S.
         P. Kodandapani.[13] Over his career, he received six National Film Awards for Best Male Playback Singer for
          his performances in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Hindii, along with 25 Andhra Pradesh state Nandi Awards for
           his work in Telugu cinema. Additionally, he was honoured various state awards from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu 
           governments,[14] four Filmfare Awards South and a Filmfare Award.[15] According to some sources, he held the 
           Guinness World Record for recording the highest number of songs by a singer with over 50,000 songs in 16 languages.
           [18] On 8 February 1981, he set a record by recording 27 songs in Kannada in a single day,
         along with 19 songs in Tamil and 16 in Hindi, which has also been called a record.[13]</p>
