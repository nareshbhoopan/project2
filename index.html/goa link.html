    <h1>GOA MOVIE</h1>
    <p>Goa is a 2010 Indian Tamil-language romantic comedy film written and directed by Venkat Prabhu in his
         third directorial project. Starring his regular cast consisting of Jai, Vaibhav, and Premji along with
          Aravind Akash, Sampath Raj, Piaa Bajpai, Sneha, and the debutant Australian model Melanie Marie in other
           roles, the film is the first production of Soundarya Rajinikanth's Ocher Picture Productions. Actors 
           Silambarasan Rajendar, Nayantara and Prasanna make guest appearances in the film, which features music
            composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, whilst cinematography is handled by Sakthi Saravanan and the film is
             edited by K. L. Praveen and N. B. Srikanth.

        The film follows the journey of three young men, Vinayagam, Ramarajan and Saamikannu,
         who flee from their remote, conservative village to escape their overly strict families and travel 
         to the international tourist-destination Goa, after encountering a friend who had fallen in love with a
          Caucasian girl whilst on holiday there. The film explores their time in Goa, the people they meet ranging
           from gay hoteliers to suave casino owners, and dwells on the relationships they encounter in the region.
        
        The film, which began pre-production work in August 2008, became highly anticipated before release due to
         the successes of the director's prior two films Chennai 600028 and Saroja. Filming began in April 2009 and 
         took place in various locations: 
        in the title location of Goa as well as in Pannapuram, Tamil Nadu and Langkawi,</p>
