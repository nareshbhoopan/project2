    <p> (transl.â€‰Prisoner) is a 2019 Indian Tamil-language action thriller film[4] directed by Lokesh
     Kanagaraj. It is produced by S. R. Prakash Babu and S. R. Prabhu under Dream Warrior Pictures and co-produced
      by Tiruppur Vivek under Vivekananda Pictures. It stars Karthi in the lead role along with Narain, Arjun Das,
       Harish Uthaman, George Maryan, and Dheena in pivotal roles. In the film, a recently released prisoner races
        against time to drive poisoned cops to a hospital while evading criminals in exchange for meeting his
         daughter.

    Lokesh initially worked on two scripts after the success of Maanagaram (2017), which he scrapped working on 
    due to issues regarding the extensive research and casting process, until he came across a news article about
     an ex-prisoner's life. He initially wanted Mansoor Ali Khan to play the lead role, but during the writing
      process, Karthi was asked to play the lead with the scale of the budget being increased further. Principal 
      photography began in December 2018 and was completed by August 2019. The film was entirely shot at night 
      without any daytime sequences taking place during the shoot. It is a songless film with a score composed by
       Sam C. S. 
    The cinematography and editing were handled by Sathyan Sooryan and Philomin Raj respectively</p>
