    <p>Shakthisree Gopalan is an Indian vocalist, composer, songwriter and performer, famous for her 
        collaborations with the top south-Indian music composers like A.R. Rahman.[1] Aside from the film music,
         she is a regular in the independent music scene,
         performing with various bands over the years dabbling in Pop, R'n'B, trip-hop and jazz.[2]

        She has also been performing and releasing music independently in multiple languages.
        
        She is an architect by profession, graduating from School of Architecture and Planning.
        
        Early life and education
        Shakthisree Gopalan was brought up in Kochi, Kerala.[citation needed] She did her schooling in
         Rajagiri Public School, Kalamassery. She moved to Chennai after her school and pursued her degree
          in architecture at the Anna University's School of Architecture and Planning.[3]
        
        She was trained in Carnatic music for 13 years. During her 11th standard, SS Music conducted Voice Hunt
         1. Since she was under 18, it ended with the auditions. Eventually in 2008, she won the second season of
         SS Music's Voice Hunt. She was first auditioned in November 2008 and got the opportunity to sing her 
         debut song for the film Taxi 4777.[4][5]</p>
