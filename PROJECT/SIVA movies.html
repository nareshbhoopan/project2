    <h1>SIVAKARTHIKEYAN MOVIES</h1>
     <p>During college, Sivakarthikeyan took part in various cultural events and performed mimicry and
         standup comedy onstage.[6] Between his studies, he took a three month-break, and during this period,
          his friends convinced him to go for auditions of Kalakka Povathu Yaaru?, a comedy reality TV show 
          airing on Star Vijay. He started his career as a mimicry artist. Despite initial reluctance to
           participate, he won the show.[7] He appeared in short films, including his friend Atlee's Mugapputhagam,
           [8] Identity, Kurahl 786, and 360Â°. The makers of Aegan noticed Sivakarthikeyan and offered him a
            supporting role in the film, but his portions did not make the final cut.[9]

        Director Pandiraj approached Sivakarthikeyan to play the lead role in his film Marina,
         and he signed the project. He prepared for the role by paying close attention to Pandiraj's 
         instructions and visiting Marina Beach extensively to study the surroundings, while revealing
          that he hoped that his natural talent of humor would come through onscreen.[10] Featuring alongside
           Oviya as a young couple in the film, Sivakarthikeyan's performance was well-received, with a critic noting "the romance adds color to a monochrome film", while the reviewer also noted that the "role of Senthilnathan requires Siva to be just himself, 
        it is just a cake walk in terms of performance for this actor."[11]</p>
