    <p>Dil Se.. (lit. 'From the Heart..') is a 1998 Indian Hindi-language romantic thriller film co-written and directed by Mani Ratnam who produced it with Ram Gopal Varma and Shekhar Kapur. Set against the backdrop of Insurgency in Assam, the film stars Shah Rukh Khan and Manisha Koirala, while Preity Zinta makes her film debut in a supporting role. An example of parallel cinema, it is noted as the final installment in Ratnam's trilogy consisting of Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995).[3][4] The film's soundtrack album, composed by A. R. Rahman, sold six million units in India.[5]

        Dil Se.. was screened at the Era New Horizons Film Festival and the Helsinki International Film Festival. Noted for its aspects of nonlinear storytelling, the film was moderately successful at the domestic box office; however, it was a major success overseas, earning $975,000 in the United States and £537,930 in the United Kingdom,[2] becoming the first Indian film to enter the top 10 in the United Kingdom box office charts,[6] and it was also a hit in Japan.[7]
        
        At the 44th Filmfare Awards, Dil Se.. received 10 nominations, including Best
         Actress (Koirala) and Best Supporting Actress (Zinta), and won 6 awards, 
         including Best Female Debut (Zinta) and Best Music Director (Rahman). At the 46th National Film Awards, the film won two awards – Best Cinematography and Best Audiography, while also receiving a Netpac Award at the 49th Berlinale.[6][8]
