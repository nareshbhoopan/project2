    <p>Biriyani is a 2013 Indian Tamil-language action comedy thriller film directed by Venkat Prabhu and 
        produced by Studio Green.[1][2][3][4] It stars Karthi and Hansika Motwani alongside an ensemble cast 
        including Premji, Nassar, Ramki, Sampath Raj, Madhumitha, Jayaprakash, Prem, and Mandy Takhar. 
        Yuvan Shankar Raja composed the score and soundtrack of Biriyani, which marks his 100th film, while
         Sakthi Saravanan and Praveen-Srikanth handled cinematography and editing, respectively.

        Filming started in November 2012, lasted for over nine months and took place primarily at Chennai,
         Hyderabad and Ambur.
        
        Biriyani was released on 20 December 2013 to mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. 
        The film was reported to be inspired by the 2004 American film Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle,
         though Prabhu was lauded for making creative changes to the story.[5] The film became a commercial success
          and recovered its budget at the box-office.[6]
        
        Plot
        The movie starts with Sugan and his friend Parasuram a.k.a. Parasu being chased by cops.
         The flashback shows Sugan as a womanizer who has a weakness for Biryani, and Parasuram is his
          childhood friend. Sugan's womaniser attitude always gets him into a fight with his girlfriend Priyanka.
           Sugan and Parasuram attend 
        a function for a branch opening of one of their offices, where they meet Varadharajan</p>
