    <p>Aayirathil Oruvan (transl.â€‰One in a Thousand) is a 2010 Indian Tamil-language action-adventure film[1][3]
        written and directed by Selvaraghavan and produced by R. Ravindran. The film stars Karthi, Reemma Sen and
         Andrea Jeremiah with Parthiban playing a pivotal role. It revolves around three characters, Muthu
          (Karthi), Lavanya (Andrea Jeremiah), and Anitha (Reemma Sen) who embark on an adventure to search for
           a missing archaeologist. It is inspired loosely by the historical decline of the Chola dynasty and
            the rise of the Pandya dynasty.

        The film's principal photography commenced in July 2007, and continued till 2008; the shooting of 
        the film took place in various locations with 2,000 extras in areas including Chalakudy, Kerala and
         Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, and also filmed in Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad.[4] The title Aayirathil Oruvan
          is taken from the 1965 film of the same name. The cinematography was handled by Ramji and editing work is
           done by Kola Bhaskar.[5] The film's background score and soundtrack album is composed by G. V. Prakash
            Kumar, replacing Selvaraghavan's usual collaborator Yuvan Shankar Raja, whom he composed for his earlier
             films. The soundtrack received rave critical acclaim and emerged as one of the composer's
         best works till date.[6]</p>
