    <p>Samantha Ruth Prabhu (formerly Akkineni; born 28 April 1987) is an Indian actress who works primarily in
         Telugu and Tamil films.[2][3] She is the recipient of several accolades, including two Nandi Awards,
          four Filmfare Awards South, six SIIMA Awards and a Tamil Nadu State Film Award.

        After a brief stint as a model while pursuing a degree in commerce, Samantha made her acting debut in
         the Telugu romance film Ye Maaya Chesave (2010), winning the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut – South. 
         She became the second actress to win both the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Tamil and Best Actress – 
         Telugu in the same year, for her performances in the 2012 films Neethaane En Ponvasantham and Eega,
          respectively. Over the next few years, she played the leading lady in top-grossing androcentric films
           such as Dookudu (2011), Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Kaththi
            (2014), Theri (2016), 24 (2016), Mersal (2017), and Rangasthalam (2018). Her performance in A Aa (2016)
             won Samantha her fourth Filmfare Award, and she gained further praise for her performances in Mahanati
              (2018), Super Deluxe (2019), and Majili (2019), and the Amazon Prime Video thriller series The Family
               Man (2021). The last of these earned her a Filmfare OTT Award. In 2023, 
        she had two critical and commercial failures in Shaakuntalam and Kushi.[4][5]</p>
