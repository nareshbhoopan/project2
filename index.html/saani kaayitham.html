        Plot
        In 1989, Ponni, a hardworking police constable without real higher-life aspirations, aims to ensure
         that her daughter Dhanam receives a good education and becomes a responsible person. Maari, Ponni's
          husband and a mill worker, aspires to break free from rampant caste issues and poverty in their village
           by getting involved in local elections. This leads to a minor conflict with one of the mill owner's
            relatives, and Maari soon gets fired. When Maari returns the next day to apologise and get his job back,
             Perumal, the mill owner, and his relatives, driven by their senseless casteism 
        and misogyny, humiliate him and make derogatory remarks about Ponni.</p>
