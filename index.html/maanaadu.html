    <p>Maanaadu (transl.â€‰Public Conference) is a 2021 Indian Tamil-language science fiction political action
         thriller film directed by Venkat Prabhu and produced by Suresh Kamatchi. The film stars Silambarasan,
          leading an ensemble cast which includes S. J. Suryah, Kalyani Priyadarshan, S. A. Chandrasekhar, Y. G.
           Mahendran, Karunakaran, Premgi Amaren, Aravind Akash and Anjena Kirti. It follows an NRI and a police
            officer who are trapped in a time loop, on the day of a public conference, and forced to live the same
             day over and over again.

        The film was officially announced in July 2018, in addition to its official title and marking Prabhu's
         maiden collaboration with Silambarasan. However, due to Silambarasan's unprofessional behaviour, which
          caused an extensive pre-production work, the producer ousted the actor in August 2019. The issues were
           resolved in November 2019, with principal photography commencing in February 2020. It was shot in Chennai,
            Pondicherry, Yercaud, and Hosur. Despite being affected twice due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic
         in India, filming wrapped by July 2021.</p>
