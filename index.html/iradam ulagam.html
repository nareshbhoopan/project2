        Plot
        Irandam Ulagam is about two stories which unfold concurrently in two different planets – our Earth and
         an unnamed exoplanet.[2] On earth a naive medical student Ramya who has a crush on an academic mathematician
          Madhu Balakrishnan, asks him out. He initially refuses her proposal for marriage as his father has a disability,
           needing his full attention and care. Later, Madhu gradually reciprocates Ramya's love seeing her caring nature 
           and proposes marriage. But, she reluctantly rejects his proposal as her family has already arranged her marriage. While on a trip to Goa, Madhu wins Ramya's heart while her fiancé abruptly cancels the marriage citing dowry as the reason. She suddenly dies in a freak accident, and this is followed by Madhu's paralysed father's death too. Depressed by the sudden twin tragedies, Madhu becomes a vagabond in Goa. He sees an apparition of his dead father that tells him death is an illusion. Later, at a local tourist spot, he follows an empty car to a hilltop and tries to commit suicide. 
        He gets injured and faints while trying to drive the car.</p>
