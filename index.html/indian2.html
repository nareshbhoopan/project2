    <p>Indian 2 (also marketed as Indian 2: Zero Tolerance) is a 2024 Indian Tamil-language vigilante action film directed by S. Shankar, who co-wrote the script with B. Jeyamohan, Kabilan Vairamuthu and Lakshmi Saravana Kumar. The film is jointly produced by Lyca Productions and Red Giant Movies. It is the second installment in the Indian film series and a sequel to Indian (1996). Kamal Haasan reprises his role as Senapathy, an ageing freedom fighter turned vigilante who fights against corruption, alongside an ensemble cast including Siddharth, S. J. Suryah, Rakul Preet Singh, Priya Bhavani Shankar, Bobby Simha, Vivek, Nedumudi Venu, Kalidas Jayaram, Samuthirakani, Manobala, Gulshan Grover, Brahmanandam, Jagan, Guru Somasundaram and Deepa Shankar. In the film, Senapathy returns to India from abroad after over two decades to aid a group in dealing with corruption in the country.

        The project was announced in September 2017. Sri Venkateswara Creations was initially on board, but opted out a month later. Lyca entered the production after that. Principal photography commenced in January 2019, and occurred sporadically over five years, before wrapping by March 2024. In 2020, an accident killed some crew members, and the COVID-19 pandemic delayed filming for two years until Red Giant Movies entered as co-producers. The technical crew includes musician Anirudh Ravichander, cinematographers Ravi Varman and R. Rathnavelu,[c] editor A. Sreekar Prasad, production designer T.
