        Pulikuthi Pandi is a rogue with nearly 20 petty cases registered against him at a police station after getting into fights. However, there is a fair reason behind his brawls: the people he beat up did immoral things to people, especially Inspector Karungali, who instructed Pandi to break a journalist's hand who wrote wrong things.
