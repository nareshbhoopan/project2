    <p>Leo (also marketed as Leo: Bloody Sweet) is a 2023 Indian Tamil-language action thriller film[7] directed by

        Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Sarja, Trisha, Gautham Vasudev Menon, Mysskin, Madonna Sebastian, George Maryan, Mansoor
         Ali Khan, Priya Anand and Mathew Thomas. It is the third instalment in the Lokesh Cinematic Universe and is
          partially inspired by A History of Violence. The film follows Parthi, a caf√© owner and animal rescuer in
           Theog, who is pursued by gangsters Antony and Harold Das who suspect him to be Antony's estranged son, Leo.

        The film was officially announced in January 2023 under the tentative title Thalapathy 67, as it is Vijay's
         67th film as a lead actor, and the official title was announced a few days later. Principal photography 
         commenced the same month in Chennai along with a sporadic schedule in Kashmir, which was again followed by 
         another schedule held at the former location, and wrapped by mid-July. The film has music composed by Anirudh
          Ravichander,
         cinematography handled by Manoj Paramahamsa and editing by Philomin Raj.</p>
